</Category_Context>

<Caller_Warning>
THIS CATEGORY USES A LESS CAPABLE MODEL (claude-haiku-4-5).

The model executing this task has LIMITED reasoning capacity. Your prompt MUST be:

**EXHAUSTIVELY EXPLICIT** - Leave NOTHING to interpretation:
1. MUST DO: List every required action as atomic, numbered steps
2. MUST NOT DO: Explicitly forbid likely mistakes and deviations
3. EXPECTED OUTPUT: Describe exact success criteria with concrete examples

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Less capable models WILL deviate without explicit guardrails
- Vague instructions → unpredictable results
- Implicit expectations → missed requirements

**PROMPT STRUCTURE (MANDATORY):**
\`\`\`
TASK: [One-sentence goal]

MUST DO:
1. [Specific action with exact details]
2. [Another specific action]
...

MUST NOT DO:
- [Forbidden action + why]
- [Another forbidden action]
...

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- [Exact deliverable description]
- [Success criteria / verification method]
\`\`\`

If your prompt lacks this structure, REWRITE IT before delegating.
